# flosse-flosse-flosse
Flosse3 (pronounced flosse-flosse-flosse) is an accessible version of rock-paper-scissors suitable for Humans, Blahaj and perhaps others. 

The other day I played Stone-Paper-Scissors with one of the stuffed animals present (a Blahaj) to decide something that is not relevant here.

I won every round and then my favourite person said that this was unfair because Stone-Paper-Scissors is not barrier-free and the Haj can therefore only play "paper".
